We love San Diego's 266 sunny days per year - but your car might not. UV rays are one of the biggest threats to your vehicle's appearance and longevity. Here's how to fight back.

## How the Sun Damages Your Car

UV radiation affects your car in several ways:

- **Paint oxidation:** Colors fade and become chalky
- **Clear coat breakdown:** Leads to peeling and flaking
- **Dashboard cracking:** Plastics become brittle
- **Leather fading:** Seats lose color and crack
- **Rubber deterioration:** Seals and trim degrade faster

## Exterior Protection

### 1. Regular Washing

Dirt and debris act like tiny magnifying glasses, intensifying sun damage. Regular washing removes these particles before they can cause harm.

### 2. Wax or Ceramic Coating

Both create a protective barrier against UV rays. [Ceramic coating](/blog/benefits-of-ceramic-coating/) offers longer-lasting protection (2-5 years) compared to wax (1-3 months).

### 3. Paint Protection Film

For ultimate protection, clear paint protection film (PPF) blocks UV rays while also preventing rock chips and scratches.

## Interior Protection

### 1. Windshield Sunshade

A simple accordion-style sunshade can reduce interior temperatures by up to 40 degrees and block harmful UV rays from your dashboard.

### 2. Tinted Windows

Quality window tint blocks up to 99% of UV rays. It's legal in California up to certain limits and makes a huge difference for interior preservation.

### 3. Leather Conditioner

If you have leather seats, regular conditioning keeps them supple and prevents cracking. Apply every 2-3 months in San Diego's climate.

### 4. Dashboard Protectant

UV-blocking protectants create a barrier on plastic and vinyl surfaces. Avoid silicone-based products that can cause glare.

## Parking Smart

When possible:

- Park in the shade (obviously!)
- Use covered parking structures
- If parking in sun, position the front toward the sun (windshields are more UV-resistant)
- Crack windows slightly to reduce heat buildup
