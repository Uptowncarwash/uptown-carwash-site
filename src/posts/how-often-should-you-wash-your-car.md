One of the most common questions we get at Uptown Car Wash is "How often should I wash my car?" The answer isn't one-size-fits-all - it depends on several factors unique to your situation.

## The General Rule

For most drivers, we recommend washing your car **every two weeks**. This frequency keeps your vehicle looking great while protecting the paint and finish from accumulated dirt, grime, and environmental contaminants.

## Factors That Affect Wash Frequency

### 1. Where You Park

If your car sits outside under trees, you'll need more frequent washes. Bird droppings, tree sap, and pollen can damage your paint if left too long. These acidic substances can etch into clear coat within 48 hours.

### 2. Your Driving Environment

Do you drive on dusty roads? Near the beach where salt air is constant? Through construction zones? These conditions call for weekly washes to prevent buildup that can damage your finish.

### 3. San Diego's Climate

Our beautiful San Diego sunshine is tough on cars. UV rays fade paint and crack dashboards. Regular washing, combined with wax or ceramic coating, provides a protective barrier against sun damage.

### 4. How Much You Drive

Highway driving exposes your car to more bugs, road debris, and tar. If you have a long commute, consider increasing your wash frequency.

## Signs Your Car Needs a Wash Now

- Visible dirt or dust on the surface
- Bird droppings or tree sap (wash within 24-48 hours!)
- Bug splatter on the front end
- Water spots from sprinklers
- Pollen coating in spring
