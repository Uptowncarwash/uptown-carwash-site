        <h2>Why Restore Your Headlights?</h2>
        <p>Over time, your vehicle's headlights can become cloudy, yellowed, or hazy due to UV exposure, oxidation, and environmental factors. This not only affects the appearance of your car but can significantly reduce visibility and safety while driving at night.</p>
