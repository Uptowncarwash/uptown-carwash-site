## Best Practices for Blog Posts

### Writing Tips

- **Keep titles short and catchy** (under 60 characters)
- **Use headings (H2, H3)** to break up long content
- **Write 300-800 words** per post for SEO
- **Include your keywords** naturally in the text
- **End with a call-to-action** ("Visit us today!" or "Schedule your detailing appointment")

### Image Tips

- **Use high-quality photos** (at least 1200px wide)
- **Keep file sizes under 500KB** for fast loading
- **Use descriptive file names**: `ceramic-coating-application.jpg` not `IMG_1234.jpg`
- **Avoid stock photos when possible** - real photos of the car wash are better!

### SEO Tips

- **Meta Description**: Write a compelling summary that makes people want to click
- **Keywords**: Include 3-5 relevant keywords
- **Headings**: Use H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections
- **Links**: Link to your services pages when relevant (e.g., mention "ceramic coating" and link to the coatings page)
